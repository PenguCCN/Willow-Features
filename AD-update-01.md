## Cave Golems

Cave golems can spawn random in caves below layer 56, regardless of light levels.

Cave golems are neutral mobs. They become hostile when a player attacks them or the light level around them is 8 or more.

Cave golems drop stone variants, many xp orbs and sometimes ancient debris.

Cave golems are strong mobs, they have 40 hearts and deal 2-3 hearts damage to the player. Their biggest weakness? They don't like pickaxes with efficiency!
